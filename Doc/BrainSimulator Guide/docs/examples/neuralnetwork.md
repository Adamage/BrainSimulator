## Neural Network examples
[XOR gate](https://github.com/GoodAI/BrainSimulatorSampleProjects/blob/master/NeuralNetworks/Xor.brain) can be emulated by a feed forward Neural Network. This example shows the actual observed error.<br>

[MNIST database](https://github.com/GoodAI/BrainSimulatorSampleProjects/blob/master/NeuralNetworks/Mnist.brain) is a common testbed for Neural Networks. This example shows the moving average of the observed error.<br>
